**Privacy Policy for Shuddhi (Bangla Text Correction App)**  

**Effective Date**: 29 November, 2024  

### **Introduction**  
Shuddhi (Bangla Text Correction App) is committed to protecting your privacy while delivering an enhanced Bangla writing experience. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle user data, particularly when using cloud-based APIs and enabling logging for debugging purposes.  

---

### **1. Data Collection and Processing**  
Shuddhi relies on cloud-based Language Model APIs (e.g., OpenAI) to perform text corrections, translations, and other features. This involves sending your input text to the cloud API for processing. Additionally, we have logging enabled for debugging purposes to ensure the app runs smoothly.  

- **What Data is Sent to Cloud APIs**:  
  - Only the text you submit for correction or translation.  
  - No personally identifiable information (e.g., names, email addresses) or metadata about your session is shared.  
- **What Data is Logged**:  
  - Logs may include anonymized data such as error messages, input/output text snippets, and usage patterns to debug issues and improve performance.  
  - Logs are securely stored and are purged regularly to minimize data retention.  

Shuddhi does not store or retain data long-term outside of debugging purposes, and no input data is used for marketing or shared with third parties beyond the API providers.

### **2. Use of Cloud API Services**  
Shuddhi leverages external cloud APIs, such as OpenAI, to deliver its core functionality. These providers may temporarily retain data for operational purposes:  

- **OpenAI Privacy Policy**:  
  OpenAI retains data temporarily for model improvement unless opted out by the developer. For details, refer to [OpenAI’s Privacy Policy](https://openai.com/policies/privacy-policy).

### **3. Permissions**  
Shuddhi may require certain permissions to function effectively:  

- **Host Permissions (Web App & Chrome Extension)**: Allows the app to process selected text directly from web pages (e.g., emails, Google Docs) upon user request.  
- **Context Menu Permissions (Chrome Extension)**: Enables quick access to features via right-click functionality.  
- **Scripting Permissions (Chrome Extension)**: Facilitates interaction with webpage content for real-time text corrections and translations.  

These permissions are strictly for providing app functionality and do not involve data collection beyond what is explicitly logged for debugging purposes.  

---

### **4. Data Security**  
We prioritize data security by ensuring:  

- **Secure Transmission**: All data sent to cloud APIs and logs are encrypted (HTTPS).  
- **Limited Access**: Logging data is securely stored, access is restricted to authorized personnel for debugging purposes only, and logs are purged regularly.  
- **Transparency**: We do not use logged data for training, marketing, or sharing with unauthorized third parties.  

---

### **5. Logging for Debugging**  
Logging is enabled to identify and resolve issues, improve performance, and enhance the user experience.  

- **What is Logged**:  
  - Limited and anonymized input/output data from the app.  
  - Error codes and system messages.  
- **How Logs Are Handled**:  
  - Logs are stored securely with restricted access.  
  - Logs are reviewed solely for debugging and operational improvements.  
  - Logs are purged periodically to reduce retention.
